Syntax-Analyzer
The Syntax Tree Generator project leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive tool for constructing and visualizing syntax trees from infix expressions. The core functionality includes parsing infix expressions into postfix notation, constructing syntax trees using a stack-based approach.The user interface, designed with HTML and styled with CSS, offers input fields for infix expressions and displays the resulting syntax tree dynamically. User input undergoes validation to ensure correctness and compatibility with the parsing algorithm. The Syntax Tree Generator project simplifies complex mathematical expressions into intuitive tree diagrams. It serves as a translator, converting convoluted math problems into structured visual representations, enhancing understanding and learning.
Postfix conversion and tree construction occur seamlessly, with animations providing a step-by-step visualization of the process.The tool also ensures the correctness of the input expression, offering validation checks, and presents the resulting tree diagram in a user-friendly interface.
Overall, the Syntax Tree Generator project combines algorithmic parsing techniques with web development principles to offer an educational and practical tool for understanding and visualizing syntax structures
